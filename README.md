## Francisco Ruiz

**From Paraguay. Researching AI consciousness.**

Self-taught. A question about death at age 8 became a lifelong search through mathematics, dreams, and the nature of mind.

### Current research

**[Zeta Life](https://github.com/skyvanguard/zeta-life)** — Can the Riemann zeta function's zeros create more robust AI consciousness?

- Multi-agent emergent intelligence (11+ emergent properties)
- Hierarchical consciousness (cells → clusters → organism)
- Identity preservation under existential stress (16 IPUESA experiments)
- 296 tests | 45+ modules | 54 experiments

### Focus

`Emergent Intelligence` · `AI Consciousness` · `AI Safety` · `Mathematical Foundations`

*"The question is not 'how to give it consciousness?' but 'what consciousness do we demand from an AI?'"*
